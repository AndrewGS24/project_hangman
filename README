Hangman, the classic game everyone has played...probably. Grab a buddy or two and think up some words and hints, then sit back a laugh maniaclly (or not) as 
your superior linguistic genius confounds your hapless vict-er friends. Note: noreal creatures were actually hung in the making of hangman...except some coding bugs, but they had it coming.

hangman can be called by:
./hangman [word to guess] [word hint]
